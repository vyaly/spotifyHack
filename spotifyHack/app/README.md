Used Flask, Python, and a Python wrapper for the Spotify API to create an app which mirrors a party host's playlist and allows them to let others access the playlist and make changes. 

Installed Flask in a virtual env.
$install virtualenv 
$source Scripts/activate . 
$pip install flask 
$pip install flask-sqalchemy #database
$pip install flask-wtf #create forms 

C:\Python27\Scripts to environment variable 


Possible future implementations: 
*playlist limited to certain genres
*drinking games implemented into the web app
